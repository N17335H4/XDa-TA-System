<!--
<li>If you are connected directly, the URL will take you to Course page, where you will select the course for which the assignment needs to be answered. If you login from External learning tool, you will directly be forwarded to the "Question list" page. You can visit the "Assignment List" link in the top of the page.</li>

  <li>The "View All Assignments" feature allows you to view all the assignments given to you. 
    You can select a desired assignment and view its details.</li>
	<li>The assignment details tells you the end date of the assignment. If it is old assignment, it will show that the assignment is overdue and duration of overdue. <br>It also provides the links for viewing the sample schema and sample data for the default schema used to solve the assignment questions. On viewing, if you want, you can download the file and run it on your database to create tables and data.</li>
   <li> When you are viewing an assignment whose due date is not over, you will be able to answer questions, or edit already answered questions.
</li>
 <img src='Images/Stud_mode.png'  alt="Student Assignment" align="center" border="0" height ="100%" width ="95%" ></img><br>

<li> On editing an answer to a question, if the assignment is in <b>Learning Mode</b>, you will get immediate feedback when you save the answer. It will show whether your query is passed or failed, Instructor's answer for the query. If your query fails, system will show the datasets for which the query failed, the expected answer for the query against the dataset and your answer against the dataset for comparison.
</li>
<li>
  If the assignment is in <b>Grading mode</b>, when you submit the query, you will get the result whether your answer passed the basic test case alone. Then the  assignment will be graded after the due date of the assignment; grading has to be manually initiated by your instructor.
   </li>
 <img src='Images/Students_Evaluated.png'  alt="Graded assignment" align="center" border="0" height ="100%" width ="95%" ></img><br>

    <li> After a particular question is graded,  the system will tell you if all test cases generated for that question have been cleared by your query (i.e. your query gave the correct answers for those test cases), or if it failed some test cases.  The system will try to provide hints on what the errors may be (but beware that the hints are often not very meaningful).
    </li>  
<li> If the assignment date is over and after it is graded by your instructor, you will be able to see the grades for the assignment on click of "View grade" link below each question. A Page like the following will be shown that contains your answers and whether they are correct or incorrect and marks awarded. </li>  



 <li>If your answer is correct, it will display the correct answer and the grade. If your answer  is incorrect, it will display "Test cases" link that shows you the details like the failed test cases, expected answer and your answer.</li>

 <img src='Images/Stud_FailedData.png'  alt="Failed Query" align="center" border="0" height ="100%" width ="95%" ></img><br>
<li>If your answer is incorrect, it will show the instructor's answer and the datasets that gave different results for your query and instructor query. The headers are descriptive about the datasets generated from  which you can know where your query went wrong.(i.e. your query gave the incorrect answers for those dataset test cases)</li>
